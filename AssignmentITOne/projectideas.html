            <h5 class="featurette-heading">Overview of My Project Idea</h5><br>
              <p class="lead">My project that I intend on developing is going to be an online study tracker that helps users understand how many hours they spend studying per study session. Users will be able to log their own study sessions by manually recording there start and finish times for each study session on any study session. Once all study sessions are inputted, users can analyse the information from the data they have inputted as they can understand how many hours they spend on each subject, overall, each day. Users can also set goals too help them study better and set study reminders and study plans on a subject and/or weekly basis. <br><br>

              <h5 class="featurette-heading">Motivation to develop an Online Study Tracker</h5><br>
                <p class="lead">I am motivated to developing this application as I am curious to know exactly how many hours of study I spend per week, month, year on my University subjects. By looking at my personal data I will know areas of improvement that I can devote more hours to my study. This project will be useful because it will help users that may struggle managing their time, as well as understand how many hours they spend studying per week which can enable them to be more alert on how they can devote their time to studying. This will be interesting for users as they can depict trends in their study patterns and understand how and where they study the most. <br><br>

Buttons will be included which will be a Create account button and Log in button. The image will be transparent with the buttons. Image will be related to someone studying.<br><br>
                  <b>Creating an account</b><br><br>

                  <b>Logging into an account</b><br><br>
                  Once users are logged into the site using their username/email and passord, there will be functional components displayed on the application homepage including
                  Logo of my company name.
                  Small carousel of images related to online study tracking.
                  A short statement of text explaining how many hours of study has been completed for the current week.
                  A central nav bar at the top of the page containing the ability to add a Study session,Look over previous study sessions and edit them, look over Subjects inputted and edit/delete them. A Dropdown menu will consist of Add Subject and Delete Subject.
                  For Add Subject an Input field which includes the name of the subject, year of subject. Another link from the dropdown menu will be a Delete/Edit subject. This will come from a table which can edit/delete subjects that are inputted from users. Plan A study session using a grid timetable with allocated times from the user. Plan a study session as users can also edit and delete planned study sessions which will be displayed in a table. Users  will also have the ability to be able to Sign out. Users will be logged out of the program once this is clicked on. If users are still logged in when they shut down the computer, they will still be logged into the site for at least 2 hours.<br><br>

              <h5 class="featurette-heading">Tools and Technologies required to develop an Online Study Tracker</h5><br>
                <p class="lead">For Hardware required, I will need to use my personal notebook computer and other computers that RMIT University may provide for use in the library. I will need to use my keyboard as a hardware input device for typing in my information into my website. <br>
                For Software required, I will need to have installed Atom as my text editor so that it can render my HTML, css, javascript, java code. I will also need to install SQL lite to be able to store records from my users inputted data. The Back end code should be able to communicate with my front end code to create a full-stack web application. <br>
                For storage,  Git hub (version control), USBS, Hard Drive, C: Drive. There will also be a cost to host the site on a server which I would need to maintain.

              <h5 class="featurette-heading">Skills requred to develop an Online Study Tracker</h5><br>
                <p class="lead">For Skills required to build an online Study Tracker, I would need to have a sound depth and knowledge of Front - End and Back - End Web Development. I am fairly strong with my front end skills as I know a lot about HTML, CSS, and Javascript and how they interact between each other. However, I need to develop skills in Programming and Database scripting so that users can save their data on my site. This will help all aspects of my web application work really well together in a systematic approach.

              <h5 class="featurette-heading">Hopeful Outcome of creating an Online Study Tracker</h5><br>
                <p class="lead">I am hoping to aid all my users in helping them in managing their study sessions, subjects and other various educational tasks that they do. Instead of having to write down study sessions or “to-do” lists on paper, they can now use an online tool that can store, save, manipulate of all their data which can be accessed from multiple devices using the internet. This will be efficient in the fact that it will save time applied for writing in study session records, effort for saving the data as all of it will be stored online, and cost will be reduced as it will be environmentally friendly as paper use will be minimised. <br><br>
